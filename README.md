# An Approach to Tight I/O Lower Bounds for Algorithms with Composite Procedures

Due to space limitations, we provide the paper's appendix in this repository.

Our exploratory experiments on NAS tasks are particularly grateful for the work on Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS).

For readers who are interested in "Introducing the I/O Lower Bound Theorem into NAS Tasks", we strongly recommend that you read the appendix first, where we explain the experimental setup and the suggestions and future directions we give based on our experimental experience. If you have more suggestions or questions, you are welcome to discuss them via email.

If you have further questions, please contact xiarui21@nudt.edu.cn

Given the randomness of experimental results, we provide the experimental samples presented in our paper to verify in TEST.zip.

More information is given in (Note: We provide the weights for about 100 epochs of training (99-100 for CIFAR100 and 108-109 for CIFAR100 (the 100-epoch weights for CIFAR100 were not saved, but the optimal model diagram generated by the test and the model weights for 108-109 epochs were saved)))：
