# An Approach to Tight I/O Lower Bounds for Algorithms with Composite Procedures

Due to space limitations, we provide the appendix of the paper in this repository.

Our exploratory experiments on NAS tasks are particularly grateful for the work on Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS).

Given the randomness of experimental results, we provide the experimental samples presented in our paper for everyone to verify.
