# An Approach to Tight I/O Lower Bounds for Algorithms with Composite Procedures

Due to space limitations, we provide the paper's appendix in this repository.

Our exploratory experiments on NAS tasks are particularly grateful for the work on Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS).

For readers who are interested in "Introducing the I/O Lower Bound Theorem into NAS Tasks", we strongly recommend that you read the appendix first, where we explain the experimental setup and the suggestions and future directions we give based on our experimental experience. If you have more suggestions or questions, you are welcome to discuss them via email.

If you have further questions, please contact xiarui21@nudt.edu.cn

Taking into account the randomness of the experimental results, we provide all the neural network models generated in 100 (101) epochs of the experiment that generated the data given in the paper in TEST.zip for verification.

For more information, see (Note: we provide the trained model weights, based on which similar results may be produced (99-100 rounds for CIFAR100, 108-109 rounds for CIFAR100 (the weights of 100 epochs for CIFAR100 are not saved, so the model weights of 108-109 epochs with late stopping are provided))):
